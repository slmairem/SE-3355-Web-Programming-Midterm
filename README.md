Here is the video of the website: https://youtu.be/av4KVC798Xg?si=zqxWFNQmSOJo-qYl

A website that is responsive and allows searching from the backend.

Flask and MySQL were used for the backend.
I attempted to use JINJA and Bootstrap for the first time.


**Advantages of the project and Database features:**
- The navbar is fixed, and other pages can appear under the navbar using JINJA.
- It can fetch images from the database and display campaigns.
- The search feature works and does not have issues with Turkish characters or case sensitivity.
- Pressing the search button without entering anything shows all products; entering a keyword in the search bar shows products containing that keyword.
- Products can be filtered by categories on the sidebar, and the categories of products are specified in the database.
- After selecting "Konun Seç" from the navbar, clicking on the "Yarın Kapımda" feature shows products belonging to that location.
- Each product has its own detail page where other features from the database can be viewed.
- Clicking on the "Hepsiburada" logo redirects to the homepage.
